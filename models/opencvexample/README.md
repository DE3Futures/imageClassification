cloned in python from: https://github.com/spmallick/learnopencv/tree/master/AgeGender

Requirements: 
- Download OpenCV from: https://opencv.org/releases/ then setup for Python in your environment.</br>

I followed the following tutorial: https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html. "Installing OpenCV from prebuilt binaries" did not work for me. Instead I followed the steps to "Build OpenCV from source". This meant I had to download Visual Studio to compile using Cmake. </br>

OR ```pip install opencv-python``` (note this is an unofficial pre-built OpenCV package for Python)

HAD DIFFICULTIES SETTING UP OPENCV. NEED TO COME BACK TO THIS.
